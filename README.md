## Stardew Valley

Stardew Valley is a farming simulation game primarily inspired by the Harvest Moon video game series. At the start of the game, the player creates their character, who becomes the recipient of a plot of land including a small house once owned by their grandfather in a small town called Pelican Town. The player may select one of five farm maps according to their preference in play styles, such as one with extra foraging spots, one with more mining resources, and another with a river used for fishing. The farm plot is initially overrun with boulders, trees, stumps, and weeds, and the player must work to clear them in order to restart the farm, tending to crops and livestock so as to generate revenue and further expand the farm's buildings and facilities.
